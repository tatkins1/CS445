Questions:
When using non typed languages dependency inversion seems to solve less problems. also since js doesn't need to be compiled
Ans: Still helps.

should everythign be classes? not just objects
should an attribute reference an id which is be mapped to an instance of a class? Should a manager be able to load shows? should the manager class have a loadshow,edit show method? or should the theatre class have these methods. Should I have a theatre class? view show , request seats are methods for the customer... right?

Ans: There are two types of class. entities which should be intuitive resusable classes as well as use cases or interactor objects.


facade:
Would having the theatre object having all the methods and having the patron interface having some of those methods that uses the instance of theatre a facade?

Observer:


Query/Set rule with the Ticket.use() function...is it that the use() is a use case and the query set only apply to more basic functions

Should classes represent physical implimentation?
Should there be one instance of seat for each seat thats in the theatre?
Should there be one instance of seat for each seat in a show? more likely because a seats availabilty depends on the show.
Should fulfilling the seats and use cases be done with class objects or can a matrix implimentation be fine?
