Questions:
When using non typed languages dependency inversion seems to solve less problems. also since js doesn't need to be compiled

should everythign be classes? not just objects
should an attribute reference an id which is be mapped to an instance of a class?

Should a manager be able to load shows? should the manager class have a loadshow,edit show method? or should the theatre class have these methods. Should I have a theatre class? view show , request seats are methods for the customer... right?

facade:
Would having the theatre object having all the methods and having the patron interface having some of those methods that uses the instance of theatre a facade?
