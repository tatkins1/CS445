###Memo to Professor:
I made the mistake of building the project without frequently referencing the API detail. When I thought I was finished I had to rewrite a lot of code to match the API. 
I also opted not to use an IDE so it was a very difficult and time consuming to refactor the code. Also with the approaching deadline I stopped writing tests and didn't follow clean coding practices. I also didn't want to rewrite tests because I needed to finish quickly. These are all mistakes you warned us about in class.  
I have dead code and irrelevant tests in the project.
