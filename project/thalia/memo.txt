Memo to Professor:
I made the mistake of building the project without frequently referencing the API detail. When I thought I was finished I had to rewrite a lot of code to match the API. 
I also opted not to use an IDE so it was a little difficult to refactor the design. Also with the approaching deadline I stopped writing tests and didn't want to rewrite tests because I needed to finish quickly. These are all mistakes you warned us about in class. 
I did not implement all design patterns that I thought were fit. 
I have dead code and irrelevant tests in the project
If I had more time I think I would like to perfect this project.
Status: Almost Done.
